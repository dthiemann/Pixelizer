# Pixelizer
A Python script that turns any image into a pixelated  one.
<br>
To execute this program, call:
<br><br>
```
python3.4 pixelizer.py file_name.ext pixel_block_size_int output_file.ext
```

# Higher Resolution Attempt Script
This is my attempt to create a program that will allow people to psuedo-increase the
resolution of their images. I have no idea if this will work, and but I thought
it would be fun to try.

Thanks for downloading!
